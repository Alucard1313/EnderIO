## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of our repositories, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, pull requests, or in any public chat channel.**

Instead, please send a Discord direct message to @rover656. If you would rather correspond over email, reach out to @rover656 to exchange details beforehand.

Please include as much detail as possible, including estimated severity, vulnerability type and any examples on how this could be vulnerable.
We will investigate the report as soon as possible and try to patch the vulnerability in all supported versions quickly.

*We will only release a patch for an unsupported version if the vulnerability is of mass-risk, for example something like a widespread [RCE](https://github.com/dogboy21/serializationisbad/blob/master/README.md)*
